# confluent_Heun_functions

Matlab/Octave code for evaluation of the confluent Heun functions

The basic functions to use:

HeunC0: confluent Heun function, equal to 1 at z=0

HeunCs0: second local solution at z=0

HeunC, HeunCs: with improvement near singularities z=1, infinity

HeunOpts: tuning of internal parameters

tested in the Octave numerical environment, intended to be Matlab compatible
